**Network Management in Active Power Distribution System** 

[*Mar. 2019 - Aug. 2020*]

- Evaluated the impacts of communication network in distributed power systems   
- Designed a learning based approximator to learn the distribution of power system metrics and network link status   
- Used SDN controller to optimize paths for distributed ADMM controllers in IEEE 123 bus system modeled in Matlab Simulink   
- Designed and implemented application in Python with using REST API supported in Onos SDN controller  for detecting and mitigating DoS attack traffic in the IEEE 68 bus system modeled in RTDS
