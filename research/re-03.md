**Federated Video Analytics System Design** 

[*Sep. 2018 - Apr. 2020*]

- Compared different object detectors for embedded devices and studied the trade-off between inference accuracy and latency with addressing the optimization of both computing and networking in the edge computing system   
- Designed algorithm for optimizing video analytics performance (accuracy/end-to-end latency of object detection) by leveraging on-device processing and computation offloading in edge computing system   
- Applied black-box optimizer to select the object detection neural network model running on embedded devices, frame resize rate, and the number of frames for offloading   
- Trained neural process to learn the distribution of system performance based on network status and system configurations   
- Built testbed with using NVIDIA Jetson TX2, nvidia-docker(GPU-enabled docker), OpenWRT router, and desktop GPUs   
- Implemented algorithms in Python to test the proposed video analytics pipeline and evaluate end-to-end performance of the system
