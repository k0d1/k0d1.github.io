**Low-Cost and Reliable Underwater Communication System** 

[*Jan. 2018 - Jul. 2018*]

- Studied challenges in underwater communication and the communication requirement for faults monitoring in underwater power systems   
- Developed underwater RF channel and optical wireless channel modules in NS-3 using C++   
- Designed and implemented the communication interfaces between OPAL-RT and GNU-Radio in C++ and Python   
- Prototyped the close-loop underwater fault monitoring power system with control signals transmitting in the lab-setup seawater environment
