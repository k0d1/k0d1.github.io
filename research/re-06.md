**Blockchain-based Federated Learning Framework Design** 

[*May 2020 - Present*]

- Designed the workflow and interfaces for federated learning applications based on Tensorflow to enable interaction of edge nodes, global nodes and blockchain nodes in the system   
- Designed and implemented smart contracts based on Ethereum network in Solidity for trading edge computing resources for federated learning tasks   
- Prototyped and tested the system in both private development chain and Ropsten testnet 
- Optimizing the interface design to increase system efficiency and reliability
