I am a PhD candidate supervised by Professor [Tao Han](https://coefs.uncc.edu/than3/) at [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.uncc.edu) (UNCC). 
My research interests include ***Edge Computing***, ***Distributed Machine Learning System***, ***Software Defined Networking***, ***Blockchain***, ***Smart Grids***.

I received my master's degree in *Control Science and Engineering* at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn) (HIT) in 2016,
and my bachelor's degree in *Automation* at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) (SCUT) in 2014.
